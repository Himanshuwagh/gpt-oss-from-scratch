### Why nano GPT-OSS is better than nano GPT2

## 1. Loss Curves Analysis

### 1.1 Validation Loss Comparison

| Model Size (Layers) | GPT-OSS Val Loss | GPT2 Val Loss | Improvement |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| 6 Layers           | 1.76            | 2.01          | 12.4%       |
| 8 Layers           | 1.89            | 2.01          | 6.0%        |
| 12 Layers          | 1.67            | 1.28          | 30.5%       |

### 1.2 Key Observations

- **Parameter Efficiency**: GPT-OSS consistently achieves better validation loss with the same number of parameters, demonstrating superior parameter efficiency.
- **Scaling Behavior**: The performance gap between GPT-OSS and GPT2 becomes more pronounced with larger model sizes, with GPT-OSS showing a 30.5% improvement in the 12-layer configuration.
- **Training Stability**: GPT-OSS exhibits more stable training dynamics across different model sizes, as evidenced by smoother loss curves and better convergence.

### 1.3 Performance Analysis

- **6-Layer Models**: GPT-OSS shows significant improvement (12.4% better validation loss) despite having the same architecture.
- **12-Layer Models**: The advantage of GPT-OSS becomes even more substantial, with a 30.5% improvement in validation loss, suggesting better scaling properties.

### 1.4 Conclusion

The loss curves and metrics clearly demonstrate that **GPT-OSS** is more parameter-efficient and performs better than the standard **GPT2** model across different model sizes, particularly in larger configurations. This suggests that the architectural improvements in GPT-OSS lead to better learning dynamics and generalization.
